Your very own TinyURL within your OWN domain! If you DO promote your blog posts in Twitter, then you MUST make your links look cool!

== Description ==

The plugin creates a shorter link for every blog post, so instead of `http://kovshenin.com/archives/wordpress-plugin-twitter-friendly-links/` you can use `http://kovshenin.com/go710`. Sweet, huh?

* Easy to setup and configure (no configuration yet.. remember, this IS beta)

If you'd like to participate in the plugin development feel free to contact me, I'll be glad to share some thoughts and guide you into the current development stage..
