Your very own TinyURL within your OWN domain! If you DO promote your blog posts in Twitter, then you MUST make your links look cool!

== Description ==

The plugin creates a shorter link for every blog post, so instead of `http://kovshenin.com/wordpress/plugins/twitter-friendly-links/` you can use `http://kovshenin.com/712`. Sweet, huh? Here's a video presentation: [Twitter Friendly Links for WordPress](http://kovshenin.com/archives/video-twitter-friendly-links-for-wordpress/ "Twitter Friendly Links for WordPress")

* Easy to setup and configure
* Switch between 302 (temporary) and 301 (permanent) redirection
* Lists all your posts/pages with short links to each
* Shows the short link in the edit post/page form together with the text you can tweet out (trimmed to 140 characters) and a link to Twitter with the predefined text
* You can output the twitter friendly link in your themes using the `twitter_link()` function
* More coming up soon!

YES, I do consider feature requests, and that is what makes this plugin work. The discussions go here: [Twitter Friendly Links](http://kovshenin.com/wordpress/plugins/twitter-friendly-links/ "Twitter Friendly Links")

== Installation ==

1. Upload archive contents to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Take a look at Twitter Friendly Links in the Settings section of your Admin panel

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I get the short link in my theme? =
Use the `twitter_link()` function in your theme (within the_loop) that returns the shortened URL. For example:

`if (function_exists("twitter_link")) { echo '<a href="' . twitter_link() . '">Twitter Friendly Link</a>'; }`

= Do I get backlinks counted by search engines with this? =
Yes you do. TinyURL links give backlinks to TinyURL.com, while short links generated by this plugin give direct backlinks to your website. This is good for SEO.

= Styling links =
If you want example.com/123 instead of example.com/go123 just browse to your plugin settings and set the style (which is "go" by default) to blank.

== Screenshots ==

1. The configuration panel
2. The posts with the pretty links
