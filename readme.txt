Your very own TinyURL within your OWN domain! If you DO promote your blog posts in Twitter, then you MUST make your links look cool!

== Description ==

The plugin creates a shorter link for every blog post, so instead of `http://kovshenin.com/archives/wordpress-plugin-twitter-friendly-links/` you can use `http://kovshenin.com/go710`. Sweet, huh?

* Easy to setup and configure
* Switch between 302 (temporary) and 301 (permanent) redirection
* Lists all your posts with short links to each
* More coming up soon!
